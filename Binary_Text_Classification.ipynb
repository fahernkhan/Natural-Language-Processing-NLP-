thirty minutes to be seated (although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting).,0,,,,\\nThe yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh.,1,,,,\\nI won\\'t try going back there even if it\\'s empty.,0,,,,\\nNo, I\\'m going to eat the potato that I found some strangers hair in it.,0,,,\\nJust spicy enough..

also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it.,0,,,,\\nWe aren\\'t ones to make a scene at restaurants but I just don\\'t get it...definitely lost the love after this one!,0,,,,\\nDisappointing experience.,0,,,,\\nThe food is about on par with Denny\\'s, which is to say, not good at all.,0,,\\nIf you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service, then this is the place for you.,0,,,\\nWAAAAAAyyyyyyyyyy over rated is all I am saying.,0,,,,\\nWe won\\'t be going back.,0,,,,\\nThe place was fairly clean but the food simply wasn\\'t worth it.,0,,,,\\nThis place lacked style!!,0,,,,\\nThe sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was $12, ridiculous.,0,,,\\nDon\\'t bother coming here.,0,,,,\\nThe meat was pretty dry, I had the sliced brisket and pulled pork.,0,,,\\nThe building itself seems pretty neat, the bathroom is pretty trippy, but I wouldn\\'t eat here again.,0,,\\nIt was equally awful.,0,,,,\\nProbably not in a hurry to go back.,0,,,,\\nvery slow at seating even with reservation.,0,,,,\\nNot good by any stretch of the imagination.,0,,,,\\nThe cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked.,0,,,,\\nThe chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless, seemed thin and watered down with no heat.,0,,,\\nIt was a bit too sweet, not really spicy enough, and lacked flavor.,0,,\\nI was VERY disappointed!!,0,,,,\\nThis place is horrible and way overpriced.,0,,,,\\nMaybe it\\'s just their Vegetarian fare, but I\\'ve been twice and I thought it was average at best.,0,,,\\nIt wasn\\'t busy at all and now we know why.,0,,,,\\nThe tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu.,0,,,,\\nThe ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting, but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits.,0,,,\\nCon: spotty service.,0,,,,\\nThe fries were not hot, and neither was my burger.,0,,,\\nBut then they came back cold.,0,,,,\\nThen our food came out, disappointment ensued.,0,,,\\nThe real disappointment was our waiter.,0,,,,\\nMy husband said she was very rude... did not even apologize for the bad food or anything.,0,,,,\\nThe only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach.,0,,,,\\nInsults, profound deuchebaggery, and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it.,0,,\\nIf someone orders two tacos don\\'t\\' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart?,0,,,,\\nShe was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door.,0,,,,\\nAfter all the rave reviews I couldn\\'t wait to eat here......what a disappointment!,0,,,,\\nDel Taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible.,0,,,,\\nIt\\'s NOT hard to make a decent hamburger.,0,,,,\\nBut I don\\'t like it.,0,,,,\\nHell no will I go back,0,,,,\\nWe\\'ve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant.,0,,,,\\nI don\\'t know what the big deal is about this place,\" but I won\\'t be back \"\"ya\\'all\"\".\",0,,,\\nI immediately said I wanted to talk to the manager but I did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar.,0,,,,\\nThe ambiance isn\\'t much better.,0,,,,\\nUnfortunately, it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees.,0,,,\\nThe food wasn\\'t good.,0,,,,\\nYour servers suck, wait, correction, our server Heimer sucked.,0,\\nWhat happened next was pretty....off putting.,0,,,,\\ntoo bad cause I know it\\'s family owned, I really wanted to like this place.,0,,,\\nOverpriced for what you are getting.,0,,,,\\nI vomited in the bathroom mid lunch.,0,,,,\\nI kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes, yet still no food.,0,,,\\nI have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would I ever return to, and this tops the list.,0,,,\\nWe started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn\\'t fresh.,0,,,,\\nFood was below average.,0,,,,\\nIt sure does beat the nachos at the movies but I would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant.,0,,,,\\nAll in all, Ha Long Bay was a bit of a flop.,0,,,\\nThe problem I have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).,0,,,,\\nShrimp- When I unwrapped it (I live only 1/2 a mile from Brushfire) it was literally ice cold.,0,,,,\\nIt lacked flavor, seemed undercooked, and dry.,0,,\\nIt really is impressive that the place hasn\\'t closed down.,0,,,,\\nI would avoid this place if you are staying in the Mirage.,0,,,,\\nThe refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland.,0,,,,\\nSpend your money and time some place else.,0,,,,\\nA lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar In her salad.,0,,,,\\nthe presentation of the food was awful.,0,,,,\\nI can\\'t tell you how disappointed I was.,0,,,,\\nI think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking.,0,,,,\\nAppetite instantly gone.,0,,,,\\nOverall I was not impressed and would not go back.,0,,,,\\nThe whole experience was underwhelming, and I think we\\'ll just go to Ninja Sushi next time.,0,,,\\nThen, as if I hadn\\'t wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check.,0,,\\n'}"
